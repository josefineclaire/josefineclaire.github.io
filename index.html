<h2>𐙚Get to know me!</h2>

<p>
Hi, I’m Josefine Claire H. Leviste, a 19-year-old college student form the Philippines. I’m always eager to learn new technologies and solve challenging problems. Welcome to my corner of the web! <br><br>
</p>

<p>
Im currently in my second year of studying Information Technology. Growing up, I was always fascinated by computers and technology, which led me to choose IT as my major, even though I’m still figuring out exactly where I want to go with it.
</p>

<p>
As of now, I’m exploring different areas within IT—like programming, networking, and cybersecurity—but I’m still a bit undecided about which path to focus on. There’s so much to learn, and sometimes it feels overwhelming, but I’m excited to keep discovering what I’m passionate about.
</p>

<p>
I haven’t joined any school clubs yet, mostly because I’m still trying to get the hang of balancing my studies with everything else. But I’m slowly getting more comfortable with college life, and who knows, maybe I’ll find a group or project that really clicks with me soon.
</p>

<p>
For now, I’m just taking things one step at a time, learning as I go, and trying to stay open to all the possibilities that this field has to offer.
</p>

<h2><br><br>𐙚Interest and Hobbies!</h2>
<p> 
When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me hiking in the mountains or playing guitar. I’m also a casual reader and enjoy listening to music, particularly pop and K-pop.

I really love listening to <a href="https://ibighit.com/bts/eng/">BTS</a> and <a href="https://pledis.co.kr/ko/artist/detail/seventeen/profile/">SEVENTEEN</a>. Their music is more than just entertainment for me—it's a source of inspiration and motivation. Their lyrics, which often talk about self-love, resilience, and chasing your dreams, resonate deeply with me. Whenever I’m feeling lost or unsure about my path, their songs remind me to keep going and to stay true to myself. The passion and dedication they put into their work inspire me to do the same in my own life, whether it’s in my studies or personal growth. Their music has become a soundtrack to my life, helping me through both the highs and lows.
